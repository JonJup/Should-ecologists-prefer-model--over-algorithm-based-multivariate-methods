  abstract        = {A critical summary of count data is its mean-variance relationship, yet this is rarely considered in multivariate analysis in ecology. This study considers what is being implicitly assumed about the mean-variance relationship in distance-based analyses - multivariate analyses based on a matrix of pairwise distances - and what the effect is of any misspecification of the mean-variance relationship. It is known that distance-based analyses make implicit assumptions that are typically out-of-step with what is observed in real data, which has major consequences. Potential consequences of this mean-variance misspecifiation are: confounding location and dispersion effects in ordinations; misleading results when trying to identify taxa in which an effect is expressed; failure to detect a multivariate effect unless it is expressed in high-variance taxa. Data transformation does not solve the problem. A solution is to use generalized linear models and their recent multivariate generalisations, which is shown here to have desirable properties.},

We defend detrended correspon- dence analysis by theoretical arguments and by reanalyzing data that previously gave bad results. We show by examples that constrained ordination can yield more informative views on effects of interest compared to unconstrained ordination (where such effects can be invisible) and show how constrained axes can be interpreted. Constrained ordination uses an ANOVA/regression approach to enable the user to focus on particular aspects of species community data, in particular the effects of qualitative and quantitative environmental variables. We close with an analysis examining the interaction effects between two factors, and we demonstrate how principal response curves can help in their visualisation. Example data and Canoco 5 projects are provided as Supplementary Material.},

To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environ- $\backslash$nmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

Unimodal models, such as the Gaussian (logistic) model, are however more difficult to fit to data than linear ones, particularly in a multi-species context in ordination, with trait modulated response and when species phylogeny and species traits must be taken into account. Adding squared terms to a linear model is a possibility but gives uninterpretable parameters. This paper explains why and when generalized linear mixed models, even without squared terms, can effectively analyse unimodal data and also presents a graphical tool and statistical test to test for unimodal response while fitting just the generalized linear mixed model.

Both species showed preference for stream pool habitats with instream cover mostly irrespective of season, indicating the existence of a microhabitat overlap. However, a certain degree of microhabitat repartition also was evident, with narrower preference profiles for introduced pumpkinseed relative to native brown trout. Overall, CAO and CQO represent a logical and useful multivariate extension to available modelling approaches in fish–habitat studies due to their ability to provide for a synoptic representation of response profiles for different species over a composite (latent) variable describing (micro)habitat characteristics.},

  abstract        = {The pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus was introduced to Europe and parts of the Mediterranean Region more than 100 years ago. However, relatively little is known of its potential ecological impacts on the native species and freshwater ecosystems of Anatolia (Turkey), where the species is currently established in ponds and rivers. In this study, interactions between L. gibbosus and native and non-native stream fishes were investigated between June 2009 and May 2010 in Sarı{\c{c}}ay Stream, a Mediterranean-type water course. Microhabitat preferences for depth, substratum composition, distance from bank and from vegetation, plant cover, velocity, turbidity and light intensity were studied by Constrained Quadratic Ordination. The species sampled in larger frequency of occurrence (and for which microhabitat relationships could be investigated) comprised endemic Smyrna chub Petroleuciscus smyrnaeus and Aegean chub Squalius fellowesii, and nonnative L. gibbosus (both juveniles and adults) and topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva. Adult L. gibbosus were found to prefer locations closer to the bank with less turbid water, plant cover, light intensity, woody structure and with sandy substratum whilst avoiding riffle habitats with coarser debris, deeper water, dense submersed aquatic vegetation and higher velocities. These preferences overlapped with those for the other nonnative species P. parva, but not with those for the endemic species and for L. gibbosus juveniles. The results of this study suggest that the potential for adverse impacts through competition for habitat ofadult L.gibbosus with the native fish fauna is not apparent in Sarı{\c{c}}ay Stream.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the European barbel Barbus barbus (L., 1758) invasion in the Tiber River basin (Italy) on the native Tiber barbel Barbus tyberinus Bonaparte, 1839, verifying whether the co-occurrence played a negative impact on growth rate and relative weight. Fish census data were collected during three periods (2000–2005, 2006–2010, 2011–2015) at 158 samp ling sites. Since its first record in 1998, European barbel rapidly spread in the study area: it was present in more than 20{\%} of the monitoring sites, where it is leading to the gradual replacement of Tiber barbel by widening its distribution in the Tiber River and in the downstream reaches of the main tributaries. By contrast, Tiber barbel has suffered from this competition, as demonstrated by the fact that the mean value of the relative weight was significantly higher where European barbel was absent. The results obtained suggested that this non-native species could be a serious threat to the conservation status of endemic Tiber barbel, and constitute the premise to underpin conservation strategies aiming to preserve native freshwater biodiversity.},

  abstract        = {Studies investigating the consequences of future climate changes on species distributions usually start with the assumption that species respond to climate changes in an individualistic fashion. This assumption has led researchers to use bioclimate envelope models that use present climate-range relationships to characterize species' limits of tolerance to climate, and then apply climate-change scenarios to enable projections of altered species distributions. However, there are techniques that combine climate variables together with information on the composition of assemblages to enable projections that are expected to mimic community dynamics. Here, we compare, for the first time, the performance of GLM (generalized linear model) and CQO (canonical quadratic ordination; a type of community-based GLM) for projecting distributions of species under climate change scenarios. We found that projections from these two methods varied both in terms of accuracy (GLM providing generally more accurate projections than CQO) and in the broad diversity patterns yielded (higher species richness values projected with CQO). Model outputs were also affected by species-specific traits, such as species range size and species geographical positions, supporting the view that methods are sensitive to different degrees of equilibrium of species distributions with climate. This study reveals differences in projections between individual- and community-based approaches that require further scrutiny, but it does not find support for unsupervised use community-based models for investigating climate change impacts on species distributions. Reasons for this lack of support are discussed},

Here, we conduct a controlled comparison of five paired SDMs and CLMs across changing climates, using palaeoclimatic simulations and fossil-pollen records of eastern North America for the pas 21 000 years. Both SDMs and CLMs performed poorly when projected to time periods that are temporally and climatically dissimilar from those in which they fit; however, CLMs generally outperformed SDMs in these instances, especially when models were fit with sparse calibration datasets. Additionally, CLMs did not over-fit training data, unlike SDMs. The expected emergence of novel climates presents a major forecasting challenge for all models, but CLMs may better rise to this challenge by borrowing information from co-occurring taxa.},

This objective is achieved by reducing the dimensionality of variable space to an efficient, low-dimensional summative model of the underlying data struc- ture that reflects the coordinated response of species to environmental factors. While multivariate methods have proven indis- pensable for analyzing both experimental and survey data in the biological sciences, considerable confusion persists regarding the selection of appropriate analytical strategies. The selection of an appropriate analytical strategy, which includes important deci- sions regarding data transformation, variable standardization and methodological approach, should be based on fundamental con- siderations of statistical appropriateness, data structure, and study objectives. Unfortunately, past and more recent assessments of multivariate analytical strategies have been based largely on empirical models of questionable relevance. This empirical approach has led to misleading recommendations and erroneous generalizations regarding the relative efficacy of the available multivariate methods. This paper dispels these misleading recommendations and provides some general guidelines for selecting appropriate data transformations, variable standardizations and methodological approaches in the multivariate analysis of biological data.},

These methods rely on distributional assumptions on the conditional abundance distributions. For abundance observations, the Poisson and the negative binomial distributions are the most frequently considered distributions. However, many large abundance studies result in many zero abundances. This may happen because of several reasons. To name one, in microbial community ecology the abundances of a very large number of species are nowadays often obtained by means of sequencing the pooled DNA sample. Due to the small sensitivity for rare species, too many observed zeroes are to be expected. Moreover, more zeroes are expected with increasing number of species.We propose a constrained ordination method based on zero-altered count distributions (e.g., zero-inflated Poisson, hurdle models). We show how the parameters and the environmental gradients can be estimated. In simulation studies we examine the behaviour of the estimators, and we apply the method to a real data set. We conclude that in the presence of zero inflation our methods give better results than the Poisson-based approaches},

Tests of significance of the individual canonical axes in redundancy analysis allow researchers to determine which of the axes represent variation that can be distinguished from random. Variation along the significant axes can be mapped, used to draw biplots or interpreted through subsequent analyses, whilst the nonsignificant axes may be dropped from further consideration. 2. Three methods have been implemented in computer programs to test the significance of the canonical axes; they are compared in this paper. The simultaneous test of all individual canonical axes, which is appealing because of its simplicity, produced incorrect (highly inflated) levels of type I error for the axes following those corresponding to true relationships in the data, so it is invalid. The marginal testing method implemented in the vegan R package and the forward testing method implemented in the program CANOCO were found to have correct levels of type I error and comparable power. Permutation of the residuals achieved greater power than permutation of the raw data. 3. R functions found in a Supplement to this paper provide the first formal description of the marginal and forward testing methods.},

The objective is similar to constrained ordinations such as canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and distance-based redundancy analysis (DB-RDA), although MFSO employs a different conceptual and algorithmic basis. Results from MFSO, CCA, and DB-RDA are compared on four data sets to determine the relative ability of the methods to identify and quantify environmental variable effect sizes on community variability. Models were fit by best all-subsets solutions and tested for significance by permutation tests. Methods were compared on the basis of variables selected and dimensionality of results and were evaluated on the basis of the correlation of the pair-wise distances of the derived ordination solutions to a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix of the taxon data, and by cross-comparisons of the inertia explained by the fitted or derived values substituted into DB-RDA and CCA analyses. MFSO and DB-RDA achieved the highest correlation with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix on one data set each, and they tied for highest correlation on the two other data sets (differences {\textless}1{\%}). CCA tied for best on one data set, tied for second on another, and achieved the lowest correlation on two data sets. When substituting MFSO- and DB-RDA-derived values into CCA, MFSO results achieved higher inertia explained on two of the four data sets; MFSO and DB-RDA achieved equivalent results on the other two. Substituting MFSO- or CCA-derived or fitted values into DB-RDA, MFSO results achieved higher inertia explained on all four data sets. While goodness-of-fit statistics were often similar across methods, the methods sometimes chose solutions of different dimensionality or employed different variables. In general, all algorithms performed well, finding relatively low-dimensional solutions that achieved high correlation with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix and explained significant amounts of inertia in the eigenanalyses. Considering both the correlation and substitution tests, MFSO achieved the best results of the three methods. DB-RDA results were nearly as good as MFSO, however, and clearly superior to CCA.},

  abstract        = {The theory of gradient analysis is presented in this chapter, in which the heuristic techniques are integrated with regression, calibration, ordination and constrained ordination as distinct, well-defined statistical problems. The various techniques used for each type of problem are classified into families according to their implicit response model and the method used to estimate parameters of the model. Three such families are considered. First, the family of standard statistical techniques based on the linear response model is dealt with, because they are conceptually the simplest and provide a basis for what follows, even though their ecological application is restricted. Second, a family of somewhat more complex statistical techniques are outlined which are formal extensions of the standard linear techniques and incorporate unimodal (Gaussian-like) response models explicitly. Finally, the family of heuristic techniques is considered based on weighted averaging. These are not more complex than the standard linear techniques, but implicitly fit a simple unimodal response model rather than a linear one. Ordination diagrams and their interpretation on bi plots and joint plots are also given in the chapter. This chapter has discussed which response model to choose from direct and indirect gradient analysis, and then in direct system, which one to choose from regression and constrained ordination. {\textcopyright} 1988, Academic Press Limited},

It does so as a joint distribution over all species providing inference on sensitivity to input variables, correlations between species on the data scale, prediction, sensitivity analysis, definition of community structure, and missing data imputation. GJAM applications illustrate flexibility to the range of species-abundance data. Applications to forest inventories demonstrate species relationships responding as a community to environmental variables. It shows that the environment can be inverse predicted from the joint distribution of species. Application to microbiome data demonstrates how inverse prediction in the GJAM framework accelerates variable selection, by isolating effects of each input variable's influence across all species.},

  abstract        = {Mesocosm experiments that study the ecological impact of chemicals are often analysed using the multivariate method 'Principal Response Curves' (PRCs). Recently, the extension of generalised linear models (GLMs) to multivariate data was introduced as a tool to analyse community data in ecology. Moreover, data aggregation techniques that can be analysed with univariate statistics have been proposed. The aim of this study was to compare their performance. We compiled macroinvertebrate abundance datasets of mesocosm experiments designed for studying the effect of various organic chemicals, mainly pesticides, and re-analysed them. GLMs for multivariate data and selected aggregated endpoints were compared to PRCs regarding their performance and potential to identify affected taxa. In addition, we analysed the inter-replicate variability encountered in the studies. Mesocosm experiments characterised by a higher taxa richness of the community and/or lower taxonomic resolution showed a greater inter-replicate variability, whereas variability decreased the more zero counts were encountered in the samples. GLMs for multivariate data performed equally well as PRCs regarding the community response. However, compared to first axis PRCs, GLMs provided a better indication of individual taxa responding to treatments, as separate models are fitted to each taxon. Data aggregation methods performed considerably poorer compared to PRCs. Multivariate community data, which are generated during mesocosm experiments, should be analysed using multivariate methods to reveal treatment-related community-level responses. GLMs for multivariate data are an alternative to the widely used PRCs.},

Here, a general causal theory is presented to explain why human societies gained the capacity to globally alter the patterns, processes and dynamics of ecology and how these anthropogenic alterations unfold over time and space as societies themselves change over human generational time. Building on existing theories of ecosystem engineering, niche construction, inclusive inheritance, cultural evolution, ultrasociality, and social change, this theory of anthroecological change holds that sociocultural evolution of subsistence regimes based on ecosystem engineering, social specialization and nonkin exchange, or "sociocultural niche construction", is the main cause of both the ...},

Apart from the fact that generalized linear models are better suited in dealing with count data, a log-transformation of counts has the additional quandary in how to deal with zero observations. With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting mod-els that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 4. We found that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently per-formed well, with little bias. 5. We recommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but instead mod-els based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.},

  abstract        = {Among the various forms of canonical analysis available in the statistical literature, RDA (redundancy analysis) and CCA (canonical correspondence analysis) have become instruments of choice for ecological research because they recognize different roles for the explanatory and response data tables. Data table Y contains the response variables (e.g., species data) while data table X contains the explanatory variables. RDA is an extension of multiple linear regression; it uses a linear model of relationship between the variables in X and Y. In CCA, the response variables are chi-square transformed as the initial step, but the relationship between the transformed response data and the explanatory variables in X is still assumed to be linear. There is no special reason why nature should linearly relate changes in species assemblages to changes in environmental variables, When modeling ecological processes, to assume linearity is unrealistic in most instances and is only done because more appropriate methods of analysis are not available. We propose two empirical methods of canonical analysis based on polynomial regression to do away with the assumption of linearity in modeling the relationships between the variables in X and Y. They are called polynomial RDA and polynomial CCA, respectively. and may be viewed as alternatives to classical linear RDA and CCA. Because the analysis uses nonlinear functions of the explanatory variables, new ways of representing these variables in biplot diagrams have been developed. The use of these methods is demonstrated on real data sets and using simulations. In the examples, the new techniques produced a noticeable increase in the amount of variation of Y accounted for by the model, compared to standard linear RDA and CCA. Freeware to carry out the new analyses is available in ESA's Electronic Data Archive, Ecological Archives},

  abstract        = {The shape of species' responses along ecological gradients has important implications for both continuum theory and community analysis. Most current theories and analytical models in community ecology assume that responses are unimodal and symmetric. However, interactions between species and extreme environmental stress may cause skewed or non-unimodal responses. To date, statistical tools for evaluating response shapes have been either inappropriate, inefficient or biased. Using a data set on vascular plant distributions along an elevation gradient, we show that Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) models are an effective method for this purpose, allowing models of various forms (skewed, symmetric, plateau, monotonic) to be tested for adequacy. HOF modeling was compared with alternative methods for response fitting, including Gaussian responses as Generalized linear model (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and Beta Functions with fixed or estimated endpoints. In our data set, skewed and plateau responses are less common than symmetric ones. Less than hall of the species have skewed or plateau responses that can not be adequately modeled by Gaussian models. We show that Beta function models with fixed endpoints are biased, confounding skewness and the location of the mode and should not be used to test response shapes. Beta models with estimated endpoints are fairly consistent with other models. GAM's cannot provide clear tests of skewness or kurtosis of response curves, though we show that GAM's, in general, confirmed the shapes chosen by HOF modeling. We provide free software for fitting HOF models and encourage further applications to community data collected along different types of ecological gradients. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract        = {The perceived threat of climate change is often evaluated from species distribution models that are fitted to many species independently and then added together. This approach ignores the fact that species are jointly distributed and limit one another. Species respond to the same underlying climatic variables, and the abundance of any one species can be constrained by competition; a large increase in one is inevitably linked to declines of others. Omitting this basic relationship explains why responses modeled independently do not agree with the species richness or basal areas of actual forests. We introduce a joint species distribution modeling approach (JSDM), which is unique in three ways, and apply it to forests of eastern North America. First, it accommodates the joint distribution of species. Second, this joint distribution includes both abundance and presence-absence data. We solve the common issue of large numbers of zeros in abundance data by accommodating zeros in both stem counts and basal area data, i.e., a new approach to zero inflation. Finally, inverse prediction can be applied to the joint distribution of predictions to integrate the role of climate risks across all species and identify geographic areas where communities will change most (in terms of changes in abundance) with climate change. Application to forests in the eastern United States shows that climate can have greatest impact in the Northeast, due to temperature, and in the Upper Midwest, due to temperature and precipitation. Thus, these are the regions experiencing the fastest warming and are also identified as most responsive at this scale.},

  abstract        = {1. Aprimary goal of ecology is to understand the fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions of species. Twomajor strands of ecology – habitat modelling and community ecology – approach this problem differently.Habitat modellers often use species distributionmodels (SDMs) to quantify the relationship between species' and their environments without considering potential biotic interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies, use co-occurrence patterns to iden- tify ecological processes. Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that integrates these dis- tinct observational approaches by incorporating species co-occurrence data into a SDM. 2. JSDMs estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and allow decomposition of species co-occurrence patterns into components describing shared environmental responses and residual patterns of co-occurrence.We provide a general description of themodel, a tutorial and code for fitting themodel in R.We demonstrate thismodelling approach using two case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria,Australia. 3. Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than residual correlations for both frogs and euca- lypts, but there were cases of strong residual correlation.Frog species generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to the fact these species occurred in similar habitats thatwere not fully described by the environmen- tal variables included in the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar environmental responses but had negative residual co-occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species may not form stable assem- blages despite having similar environmental affinities. 4. Environmental and residual correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether co-occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic interactions), or if important predictor variables are missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions of species might be related to each other and thus overcome amajor limitation ofmodelling species distributions indepen- dently},

  abstract        = {Abiotic factors such as climate and soil determine the species fundamental niche, which is further constrained by biotic interactions such as interspecific competition. To parameterize this realized niche, species distribution models (SDMs) most often relate species occurrence data to abiotic variables, but few SDM studies include biotic predictors to help explain species distributions. Therefore, most predictions of species distributions under future climates assume implicitly that biotic interactions remain constant or exert only minor influence on large-scale spatial distributions, which is also largely expected for species with high competitive ability. We examined the extent to which variance explained by SDMs can be attributed to abiotic or biotic predictors and how this depends on species traits. We fit generalized linear models for 11 common tree species in Switzerland using three different sets of predictor variables: biotic, abiotic, and the combination of both sets. We used variance partitioning to estimate the proportion of the variance explained by biotic and abiotic predictors, jointly and independently. Inclusion of biotic predictors improved the SDMs substantially. The joint contribution of biotic and abiotic predictors to explained deviance was relatively small ( 9{\%}) compared to the contribution of each predictor set individually ( 20{\%} each), indicating that the additional information on the realized niche brought by adding other species as predictors was largely independent of the abiotic (topo-climatic) predictors. The influence of biotic predictors was relatively high for species preferably growing under low disturbance and low abiotic stress, species with long seed dispersal distances, species with high shade tolerance as juveniles and adults, and species that occur frequently and are dominant across the landscape. The influence of biotic variables on SDM performance indicates that community composition and other local biotic factors or abiotic processes not included in the abiotic predictors strongly influence prediction of species distributions. Improved prediction of species' potential distributions in future climates and communities may assist strategies for sustainable forest management.},

Big data generally refer to massive volumes of data not readily handled by the usual data tools and practices and present unprecedented opportunities for advancing science and inform- ing resource management through data-intensive approaches. The era of big data need not be propelled only by “big science” – the term used to describe large-scale efforts that have had mixed success in the individual-driven culture of ecology. Collectively, ecologists already have big data to bolster the scientific effort – a large volume of distributed, high-value information – but many simply fail to contribute. We encourage ecologists to join the larger scientific community in global initiatives to address major scientific and societal problems by bringing their distributed data to the table and harnessing its collective power. The scientists who contribute such information will be at the forefront of socially relevant science – but will they be ecologists?},

  abstract        = {{\textcopyright} 2017 International Biometric Society In this paper we consider generalized linear latent variable models that can handle overdispersed counts and continuous but non-negative data. Such data are common in ecological studies when modelling multivariate abundances or biomass. By extending the standard generalized linear modelling framework to include latent variables, we can account for any covariation between species not accounted for by the predictors, notably species interactions and correlations driven by missing covariates. We show how estimation and inference for the considered models can be performed efficiently using the Laplace approximation method and use simulations to study the finite-sample properties of the resulting estimates. In the overdispersed count data case, the Laplace-approximated estimates perform similarly to the estimates based on variational approximation method, which is another method that provides a closed form approximation of the likelihood. In the biomass data case, we show that ignoring the correlation between taxa affects the regression estimates unfavourably. To illustrate how our methods can be used in unconstrained ordination and in making inference on environmental variables, we apply them to two ecological datasets: abundances of bacterial species in three arctic locations in Europe and abundances of coral reef species in Indonesia.

  abstract        = {Abstract In exploring the relationship between multivariate abundance data and environmental variables, a rarely used approach is to graph raw data separately for each different taxon. It is proposed that such raw data graphs become part of the standard toolset for graphing and analysing multivariate abundances. The key advantage of this approach is that axis scales have quantitative interpretations, enabling quantitative interpretation of patterns in abundance. In contrast, ordinations only present qualitative information. Ordinations are useful for inferring overall, qualitative patterns and raw data graphing is a complementary tool of greater use for answering more specific questions, aimed at a deeper understanding the ecology of a community. It is demonstrated using some well-known examples that our understanding of the nature of associations can be considerably improved by using raw data graphs, even when only plotting a subset of variables. One example describes how an often-cited dataset has been misinterpreted in key methodological papers, because data were interpreted from ordinations alone, with no consideration of plots of the raw data.},

I review some of the more persistent criticisms of P values and argue that most stem from misunderstandings or incorrect interpretations, rather than from intrinsic shortcomings of the P value. I show that P values are intimately linked to confidence intervals and to differences in Akaike's information criterion (deltaAIC), two metrics that have been advocated as replacements for the P value. The choice of a threshold value of deltaAIC that breaks ties among competing models is as arbitrary as the choice of the probability of a Type I error in hypothesis testing, and several other criticisms of the P value apply equally to deltaAIC. Since P values, confidence intervals, and deltaAIC are based on the same statistical information, all have their places in modern statistical practice. The choice of which to use should be stylistic, dictated by details of the application rather than by dogmatic, a priori considerations.},

  abstract        = {In this paper, a case is made for the use of model-based approaches for the analysis of commu- nity data. This involves the direct specification of a statistical model for the observed multivariate data. Recent advances in statistical modelling mean that it is now possible to build models that are appropriate for the data which address key ecological questions in a statistically coherent manner. Key advantages of this approach include interpretability, flexibility, and effi- ciency, which we explain in detail and illustrate by example. The steps in a model-based approach to analysis are outlined, with an emphasis on key features arising in a multivariate context. A key distinction in the model-based approach is the emphasis on diagnostic checking to ensure that the model provides reasonable agreement with the observed data. Two examples are presented that illustrate how the model- based approach can provide insights into ecological problems not previously available. In the first exam- ple, we test for a treatment effect in a study where different sites had different sampling intensities, which was handled by adding an offset term to the model. In the second example, we incorporate trait information into a model for ordinal response in order to identify the main reasons why species differ in their environmental response.},
